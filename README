This is an IRC bot written in C# with several IRC/text based games built in.
It also has several commands that allow it to be controlled by the channel
users.


This project will not build as-is, you must configure it by editing the Member Variables inside of the IrcBot class in IrcBot.cs before the project will build correctly.


Once configured set the "configured" variable to true so that the bot will work properly.
